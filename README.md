# Overview

This was a project I accomplished in order to further my understanding of JavaScript. I wanted to use Vanilla Javascript to challenge myself while creating a single-page application(SPA) with multiple views and different functions. I chose not to use React.JS or Angular.JS to really push myself to understand how things were going together, and learn a new way to create a SPA.

The main shell of my site is still HTML5. This was important so there was a framework to build off of, and this is also where my styles.css file was attached. However, only mostly static information, like the header was hard-coded into my HTML page. The majority of the page content was done through DOM manipulation in my JavaScript file. There was heavy use of arrays, as that is where the items themselves are stored.

I wrote this software to give users a to-do list in the form of a web application, versus a traditional pen and paper list. Items are able to be deleted, which is different than a paper one where something could potentially be erased, but it might not be fully gone. This list allows a to do list to be tracked with the option to cross things out, and then delete them entirely after.

# Development Environment

I used JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. Native Array ES6 functions were used to alter and view the to do list in different forms. I created this project using VSCode while writing and learning.

# Future Work

- Store lists to a database
- Create authentication so a user can log in and have their lists saved
- Make a deleted list so a user can see items they deleted
